# CADLabs Ethereum Model Documentation

The documentation is split into two parts:
1. A JupyterBook website with Experiment Notebooks and assorted Markdown documentation
2. The model code documentation generated from Python docstrings: <a href="docs/index.html">Model Documentation</a>

Check out the README notebook to get started with the experiments addressing research questions and corresponding scenario analyses, or dig into the code.
