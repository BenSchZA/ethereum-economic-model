# Research Roadmap

## Model Extensions

Assorted technical extensions ("future features") and advanced scenario analyses of the model:

* Implement the ability to simulate an inactivity leak scenario
* Implement a dynamic EIP1559 basefee with a feedback loop based on blockspace demand / network congestion
* Extend the model to cover future Ethereum upgrade stages after merge, such as sharding
* Implement caching of results for improved simulation performance
* Backtest the model against historical data such as the ETH price, ETH staked to determine expected historical yields
* Apply Hoban/Borgers security (cost of attack) and required rate of return (RSAVY) analysis to simulation results
* ... **your extension idea here!**
